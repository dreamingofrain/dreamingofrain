i do not bite i swear please feel free to c+h, int/w2int, boop my pixelated pony, ANYTHING!! i hate sitting alone!! just dont be a weirdo ðŸ¥²

i follow people from ponytown who has github if they have similar interests/i think are just really cool, i also try to follow back if its possible^^

i got asked this recently soo: idm if you take inspo from my skins!! just to add on no big heavy inspo or outright copying the whole skin ðŸ˜­

tone tags would actually be pretty helpful to me (something i learned about myself when conversing with friends), but it's okay if you don't want to use them!
