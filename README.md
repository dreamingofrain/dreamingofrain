_Didn't you see the news today?
I heard they said it looked like rain_ 

_All the words I left unsaid that day
Stained the sidewalk drop by drop with gray..._

âœ¦ please dont be scared to int becuz im probably more scared than you !! /hj, but i swear im a friendly and nice person that tries - please feel free to c+h, int/w2int, kiss/boop my pixelated pony, ANYTHING!! i love meeting new people and potentially new friendos to add to my list (*rubs hands evilly*) - it does take a bit of time for me to warm up to new peeps but i promise after a few chats ill eventually get more comfortable !!

âœ¦ please dont make excessive freaky/flirty jokes - i dont mind minimal but too much can genuinely make me feel uneasy

âœ¦ I may be nonverbal or verbal, it really just depends on my mood tbh ^^

âœ¦ Im most likely gonna be using cosponies of characters from media im currently hyperfixated in

âœ¦ i follow people from ponytown who has github if they have similar interests/i think are just really cool, i also try to follow back followers if its possible^^

â˜‚ _Rain or shine, I'm by your side -
So why won't you look my way?_

_The weather forecast's calling for another cloudy day._
