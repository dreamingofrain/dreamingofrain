extended about me 🤷‍♀️:

. firstly and most important. MINOR. im a minor okay, so no weird stuff when interacting with me, yeah?

. on default, i tend to refer to the person/people im talking to as bro, dude, man etc..., if that bothers you, i will try my best to limit that and call you another name you're comfortable using, but it is possible that i will slip up from time to time

. i probably have the most broken, corniest sense of humor ever. just a warning i guess LOL

. im very awkward at first but i also try my really best to be friendly!! i do also switch to a yapper mode when i start talking about my interests (especially the more obscure, lesser known ones!!!)
