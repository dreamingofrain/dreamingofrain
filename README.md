_Didn't you see the news today?
I heard they said it looked like rain_ 

_All the words I left unsaid that day
Stained the sidewalk drop by drop with gray..._

âœ¦ i do not bite, i swear im a friendly and nice person!! please feel free to c+h, int/w2int, boop my pixelated pony, ANYTHING!! i love meeting new people and potentially new friendos - it does take a bit of time for me to get used to new peeps tho

âœ¦ i follow people from ponytown who has github if they have similar interests/i think are just really cool, i also try to follow back followers if its possible^^

â˜‚ _Rain or shine, I'm by your side -
So why won't you look my way?_

_The weather forecast's calling for another cloudy day._
